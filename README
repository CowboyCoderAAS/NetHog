this is the netHog project I made from my networking class back in university
I made improvments from the inital requirments and added a lot of bells and wissles 
I changed the file names from the original project named piggy to hopfully prevent students
from easily plagerizing my product.

IF YOU ARE A STUDENT AND ARE DOING THIS NETWORKING PROJECT IT IS PLAGERISM TO USE MY CODE

tenically my lisense does not cover that except that you must include my copyright in your source code and stuff. 

netHog is what I would call my best and my worst work ever. It is by far the project that I have put the most time into,
and because of that has bugs that I have not found / have not fixed yet.

Also the migration to the new file names might have broken some stuff so send me a message if that happens so I can fix it

I probably would like to do more with this program like making it portable and installable and clearner and stuff.

enjoy and God bless!
